The Crude Blast Furnace is used to make Steel (and Slag as a byproduct from version 0.7 onwards). Coal Coke or Charcoal can be used as a fuel. One piece of Coal Coke will smelt exactly one Iron Ingot to create 1 Steel Ingot and Slag. Automating the Crude Blast Furnace via Hoppers or any sort of piping is not possible; for that, the player needs to build an Improved Blast Furnace. A Block of Coal Coke can be used as fuel with 11.11% extra efficiency. A Block of Iron can be used instead of an Iron Ingot, although it does not have any extra efficiency except for time. The Coke Oven can be used to create more Coal Coke.
